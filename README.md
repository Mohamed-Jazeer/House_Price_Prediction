# House_Price_Prediction
This notebook explores the housing dataset from Kaggle to predict Sales Prices of housing using regression techniques such as feature engineering and Linear Regression.

# Working Method
The objective of this machine learning project is to develop a model that can accurately predict the prices of houses based on location, square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and other relevant factors. Performing the data cleaning, data analysis and pre-processing and implemented the Machine Learning algorithm to make prediction.

# Model Building
The outcome of this machine learning project is to develop a model that can accurately predict the prices of houses based on various features with a high degree of accuracy.
